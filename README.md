Powershell script to check selected folders for Plex naming convention

eg "Lucifer - S02E05 - Weaponizer.mkv"

Any files not matching this format will be outputted to screen along with their file location.

Requires Powershell V4. If not already installed, please find your correct download here.....

I've now added an executable version of the script with a gui. Simply browse to the root folder (or copy and paste a directory) and click scan.


If anyone downloads and uses this file, I would really appreciate and welcome any feedback.
